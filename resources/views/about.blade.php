            India Tours was born from a simple belief: every traveler deserves to experience the real India. Founded in 2010 by travel enthusiast Rajesh Sharma, we started as a small local guide service and have grown into one of India's most trusted travel companies.
            What sets us apart is our deep connection to India's diverse cultures, languages, and traditions. Our team of local experts doesn't just show you the famous landmarks – we take you beyond the guidebooks to discover hidden gems, authentic experiences, and genuine connections with local communities.
            From the snow-capped Himalayas to the tropical beaches of Kerala, from ancient temples to modern cities, we curate journeys that reveal the many faces of India while ensuring your comfort, safety, and satisfaction every step of the way.
